## Perfest frontend
**Proudly built with** [**react-native-web**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and powered by [**typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Perfest
* Perfest is an online ticketing and event portal which was used at the D. Y. Patil University, Mumbai tech fest
* It uses QR codes for ticketing. No more paper management and printing hassels.
* Perfest provides robust logging, data management and analytics. It is fully integrated with Sentry 
* It greatly reduces time and efforts for ticketing. We recieved over 5K users in a week which is more than what we would have if we had done manual ticketing


"React Native for Web" makes it possible to run [React
Native][react-native-url] components and APIs on the web using React DOM. Check
out the live demo of the [React Native examples][examples-url] running on the
web.

* **High-quality web interfaces**: makes it easy to
create [fast](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/benchmarks/README.md),
adaptive web UIs in JavaScript. It provides native-quality interactions, support
for multiple input modes (touch, mouse, keyboard), optimized vendor-prefixed
styles, built-in support for RTL layout, built-in accessibility, and integrates
with React Dev Tools.

* **Write once, render anywhere**: interoperates with existing React DOM
components and is compatible with the majority of the React Native API. You can
develop new components for native and web without rewriting existing code.
React Native for Web can also render to HTML and critical CSS on the server
using Node.js.
